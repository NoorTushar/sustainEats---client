# Project Overview

Our platform aims to facilitate the sharing of surplus food within the community, reducing food waste and supporting those in need. Built using modern technologies such as React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, our platform offers a user-friendly interface and seamless user experience.

# Key Features

1. **CRUD Operations**: Our platform supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add new foods, update existing ones, and delete foods they no longer wish to share. This enables users to manage their food listings efficiently and keep their information up to date.

2. **Make Donation using Stripe**: You can make donation to us by using Stripe payment system. Check your donations in the 'My Donations' tab.

3. **Authentication**: We provide a robust authentication system that allows users to register and log in securely. Social login options via Google and Github are also available for convenience.

4. **Search and Sort Functionality**: Users can easily search for specific foods by name and sort them based on expiration date, enhancing the browsing experience and making it easier to find relevant items.

5. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

6. **Dynamic Content**: The platform dynamically fetches and displays content, such as available foods and user requests, ensuring that users always see the latest information.

7. **Private Routes**: Certain routes, such as adding food and managing user-specific data, are protected and accessible only to authenticated users, ensuring data privacy and security.

8. **Interactive UI Elements**: Our platform features interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and modals, providing users with intuitive controls and a seamless browsing experience.

9. **Error Handling**: We implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide users with helpful error messages, ensuring a smooth and frustration-free experience.
